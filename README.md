## About the Dashboard

To respect data confidentiality, the original business data used at SLB is **not included** in this repository.

Instead, I have recreated the dashboard using publicly available data from Kaggle:  
ðŸ”— [Retail Store Inventory Forecasting Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anirudhchauhan/retail-store-inventory-forecasting-dataset)

This simulated dashboard reflects the **same structure and analytical goals** as the original version developed during my internship.
